## Q&A

- Q: How social data is saved. 

A: Everyone's data is their private property and should be kept and maintained by themselves. So all personal data, such as updates, comments, likes, videos and images, and other files. They are all responsible for storage themselves. Corresponding to this project, personal data is saved in their own git warehouse.

- Q: How does the interaction between users proceed? 

A: The dynamic posted by user A is pushed to their own git warehouse, and user B has added user A's git warehouse address for attention. User B can pull updates from User A to their local location when pulling. This project will read and pull local data, and then integrate it to display to user B. User B's comments and likes on this dynamic are all submitted and saved to their own git repository. If User A also follows User B. You can see user B's comments and likes on themselves. If you don't follow, you won't see user B's comments and likes on you. If user C follows both user A and user B, then user C can see.
